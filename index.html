          <h3>Push‑Ups</h3>
          <p>
            Push‑ups strengthen your chest, triceps and shoulders. Begin in a
            plank position with your hands just outside shoulder width. Keep
            your body in a straight line, lower yourself until your elbows are
            near 90&nbsp;degrees, then press back up. Beginners can modify by
            placing knees on the ground.

          <h3>Squats</h3>
          <p>
            Squats target your quads, glutes and hamstrings. Stand with feet
            shoulder‑width apart, toes forward. Brace your core and lower
            yourself as though sitting into a chair, keeping knees behind toes.
            Press through your heels to return to standing.

        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Walking Lunges</h3>
          <p>
            Lunges work the quads, hamstrings and glutes while challenging
            balance. From standing, step forward into a lunge so your front knee
            bends to 90&nbsp;degrees and the back knee hovers just above the
            floor. Push through the front foot to stand and repeat on the other
            leg while walking forward.

        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Lateral Lunges</h3>
          <p>
            This side‑to‑side variation develops inner‑ and outer‑thigh
            muscles. Start standing tall with feet together and core engaged.
            Step out to the side, bending your knee and shifting your weight
            over the lunging leg. Push the hips back slightly to load the
            glutes, then return to standing and repeat on the opposite side.
          </p>

        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Standing Calf Raises</h3>
          <p>
            Focus on the calf muscles by standing with feet hip‑width apart and
            knees slightly bent. Push through the balls of your feet to lift
            your heels as high as possible, pausing briefly at the top before
            lowering back down.

        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Box Jumps</h3>
          <p>
            A plyometric exercise that builds lower‑body power. Face a sturdy
            box or bench with feet hip‑width apart. Swing your arms back and
            explosively jump onto the box, extending your hips, knees and
            ankles. Land softly with both feet and step down carefully. Start
            with a low platform and increase the height as you gain strength.

          <h3>Planks</h3>
          <p>
            A classic isometric hold that targets the deep abdominal muscles.
            Place your elbows under your shoulders and extend your legs behind
            you, balancing on your toes. Keep your body in a straight line and
            hold this position while maintaining a braced core. Start with
            30&nbsp;seconds and build toward longer holds.

        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Glute Bridges</h3>
          <p>
            Strengthen your hips and hamstrings by lying on your back with
            knees bent and feet flat. Brace your core, press into the floor and
            lift your hips until you form a straight line from shoulders to
            knees. Squeeze your glutes at the top, pause and slowly lower down.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Side Planks</h3>
          <p>
            This variation emphasises the obliques. Lie on one side with your
            elbow under your shoulder. Press your forearm into the floor and
            raise your hips until your body forms a straight line. Hold while
            keeping a braced core, then switch sides. Beginners can perform
            side planks on their knees.

          <h3>Dead Bugs</h3>
          <p>
            A dynamic core exercise that promotes spinal stability. Lie on your
            back with knees bent at 90&nbsp;degrees and arms extended toward the
            ceiling. Flatten your lower back into the floor. Slowly extend your
            right leg and left arm away from your body without letting your
            back arch. Return to the starting position and alternate sides.

          <h3>Burpees</h3>
          <p>
            Burpees deliver a full‑body cardiovascular challenge. Start standing,
            drop into a squat and place your hands on the floor. Jump your feet
            back into a plank, then return them toward your hands. Finish with
            an explosive vertical jump, arms overhead. Remove the jump at the
            end to reduce intensity.

        <article class="exercise">
          <h3>Jumping Jacks</h3>
          <p>
            A simple cardio move that gets your heart rate up. Stand with feet
            together and arms at your sides. Jump your feet out while raising
            your arms overhead in an arc. Hop back to the starting position
            with a soft landing and repeat in a rhythmic fashion.
